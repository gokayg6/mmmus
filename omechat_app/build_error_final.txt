Alternatively, use the flag "--android-skip-build-dependency-validation" to bypass this check.

Potential fix: Your project's gradle version is typically defined in the gradle wrapper file. By default, this can be found at C:\
Users\gokay\Desktop\Ome\omechat_app\android/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties. 
For more information, see https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html.

Warning: Flutter support for your project's Android Gradle Plugin version (Android Gradle Plugin version 8.3.0) will soon be dropp
ed. Please upgrade your Android Gradle Plugin version to a version of at least Android Gradle Plugin version 8.6.0 soon.
Alternatively, use the flag "--android-skip-build-dependency-validation" to bypass this check.

Potential fix: Your project's AGP version is typically defined in the plugins block of the `settings.gradle` file (C:\Users\gokay\
Desktop\Ome\omechat_app\android/settings.gradle), by a plugin with the id of com.android.application. 
If you don't see a plugins block, your project was likely created with an older template version. In this case it is most likely d
efined in the top-level build.gradle file (C:\Users\gokay\Desktop\Ome\omechat_app\android/build.gradle) by the following line in t
he dependencies block of the buildscript: "classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:<version>'".

Warning: Flutter support for your project's Kotlin version (1.9.0) will soon be dropped. Please upgrade your Kotlin version to a v
ersion of at least 2.1.0 soon.
Alternatively, use the flag "--android-skip-build-dependency-validation" to bypass this check.

Potential fix: Your project's KGP version is typically defined in the plugins block of the `settings.gradle` file (C:\Users\gokay\
Desktop\Ome\omechat_app\android/settings.gradle), by a plugin with the id of org.jetbrains.kotlin.android. 
If you don't see a plugins block, your project was likely created with an older template version, in which case it is most likely 
defined in the top-level build.gradle file (C:\Users\gokay\Desktop\Ome\omechat_app\android/build.gradle) by the ext.kotlin_version
 property.

Warning: The plugin flutter_webrtc requires Android SDK version 36 or higher.
For more information about build configuration, see https://flutter.dev/to/review-gradle-config.
Your project is configured to compile against Android SDK 35, but the following plugin(s) require to be compiled against a higher 
Android SDK version:
- flutter_webrtc compiles against Android SDK 36
Fix this issue by compiling against the highest Android SDK version (they are backward compatible).
Add the following to C:\Users\gokay\Desktop\Ome\omechat_app\android\app\build.gradle:

    android {
        compileSdk = 36
        ...
    }
