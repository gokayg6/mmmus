            <h3>12.1 Informal Resolution</h3>
            <p>Before filing a claim, you agree to try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting us. We will
                attempt to resolve the dispute informally within 60 days.</p>

            <h3>12.2 Arbitration Agreement</h3>
            <p>If informal resolution fails, you agree that any dispute will be resolved through binding arbitration

                <li>Intellectual property disputes</li>

            </ul>

            <h3>12.3 Class Action Waiver</h3>
            <p>You agree to bring claims only in your individual capacity and not as part of any class or representative
                action.</p>

            <h2>13. Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h2>
